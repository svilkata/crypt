# This repo is all about implementing encrypting and decrypting algorithms - symmetric, asymmetric, combined.

##### Demos are done from Udemy courses.

##### I am using Java 21 for the demos. And for some demos I am using the Bouncy Castle provider `bcpkix-jdk18on` and/or `bcprov-jdk18on`.

##### You can open the project in your IntelliJ IDE - from main folder `cryptography` or from the subfolder `cryptodemos`.

##### You can also check the OpenSSL CheatSheet.

##### If having trouble with the Java version, check also these 2 IntelliJ settings:
- Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Java Compiler
- Project Structure -> ....
