This repo is all about implementing encrypting and decrypting algorithms - symmetric, asymmetric, combined.

Demos are done from Udemy courses.

I am using Java 21 for the demos. And for some demos I am using the Bouncy Castle lib.

You can open the project in your IntelliJ IDE - from main folder `cryptography` or from the subfolder `cryptodemos`.
